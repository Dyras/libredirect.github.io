      <p>Requirements</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open Source</li>
        <li>Enhances Privacy over main site</li>
        <li>Can be self-hosted. So, It's Decentralized</li>
        <li>Using it is really hard without automated redirections</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Good Examples</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/zedeus/nitter" class="green">Nitter</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/iv-org/invidious" class="green">Invidious</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/spikecodes/libreddit" class="green">Libreddit</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://git.sr.ht/~metalune/simplytranslate_web" class="green">SimplyTranslate</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Bad Examples</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://pixiv.moe/" class="red">PixivMoe</a> - Only 1 instance, requires login, uses Google Analytics</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.startpage.com/" class="red">Startpage</a> - There's already an <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/startpage-private-search/">extension</a> for it, doesn't require automated redirections. Just set it as your default Search Engine. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</li>
        <li><a href="https://old.reddit.com/" class="red">Old Reddit</a> - There's already an <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/old-reddit-redirect/">extension</a> for it</li>
        <li><a href="https://pinafore.social/" class="red">Pinafore</a> - It's is a full featured web app for <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, not a frontend.</li>
        <li><a href="https://playsoju.netlify.app/" class="red">Soju</a> - It's just a website that gives you samples of spotify songs, not a frontend. If you want to use it, just visit their <a href="https://playsoju.netlify.app/">website</a> and paste the spotify link you want to get a sample of.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="why_forking_privacy_redirect"><a href="#why_forking_privacy_redirect">Why forking Privacy Redirect?</a></h2>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/SimonBrazell/privacy-redirect">Privacy Redirect</a> hasn't been maintained since 6/12/2021. Many instances are hard coded and should be removed as they became offline and many others should be added. Many Pull Requests were just pending and waiting. So we stepped in. This was the main reason. Later though, we started improving more by adding new features and frontends.</p>
      <h2 id="why_all_those_permissions"><a href="#why_all_those_permissions">Why all those permissions?</a></h2>
      <p>let's go on them one by one:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/webRequest">webRequest</a>, <y>webRequestBlocking</y>: To block <code>http</code> requests or redirect them. Examply like, To redirect to Invidious before it can reach YouTube's servers.</li>
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/storage">storage</a>: To save LibRedirect's settings permanently.</li>
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/cookies">cookies</a>: To apply settings across multiple instances. Note that we also use localStorage. Those options are disabled by default though.</li>
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/menus">menus</a>: For adding some buttons to the right click menu:</li><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40805353/160441937-dc0c71a9-bed1-4078-81a1-189f8ff21c0e.png">
        <li> <y>&lt;all_urls&gt;</y>: LibRedirect is dynamic and customizable. The targets e.g <a href="https://youtube.com">youtube.com</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com">twitter.com</a> are written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">Regex</a> and are much more complicated than to be hard-coded in the manifest. Ex:  <a href="https://github.com/libredirect/libredirect/blob/master/src/assets/javascripts/helpers/search.js#L6=">search Regex</a>. Further more, we need to access the instances sites too to inject some localStorage variables.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="where_the_hell_are_those_instances_coming_from"><a href="#where_the_hell_are_those_instances_coming_from">Where the hell are those instances coming from?</a></h2>
      <p>Every frontend project has a list of public instances. Ex: <a href="https://api.invidious.io/">Invidious' official instances list</a>, <a href="https://github.com/zedeus/nitter/wiki/Instances">Nitter's official instances list</a>. We fetch those lists using an automated <a href="https://github.com/libredirect/libredirect/blob/master/src/instances/get_instances.py">python script</a>. This script gets triggered every 3 days. We don't intercept it nor modify the lists. They're not our responsibility, they're the projects maintainers' except Piped because the Project Maintainer doens't maintain URL of Instances rather API links to connect to other Instances via Frontend.</p>
      <h2 id="why_not_using_a_single_reputable_instance"><a href="#why_not_using_a_single_reputable_instance">Why not using a single reputable instance?</a></h2>
      <p>We can make all the redirections based on e.g <a href="https://pussthecat.org/">pussthecat.org</a>. This server is a really reputable and trusted server. Problem is that we'll just kill it with DDoS attacks. Most of these servers are small and some are even hosted from homes. Though if they were somehow able to handle the load, then they won't be able to handle the costs.</p>
      <p>At the end, each person should pick and use one or more instances that the user trusts. It's their own choice.</p>
      <h2 id="it_is_not_working_at_all"><a href="#it_is_not_working_at_all">It's not working at all!</a></h2>
      <p>This happens weirdly after updating to a new version. Just reinstall it. If it didn't help, open an <a href="https://github.com/libredirect/libredirect/issues">issue</a>.</p>
      <h2 id="chrome_web_store"><a href="#chrome_web_store">Chrome Web Store?</a></h2>
      <p>We can't publish it to the Chrome Web Store as it requires manifest v3 and we use manifest v2. You can still <a href="https://github.com/libredirect/libredirect/blob/master/chromium.md">Install</a> it though. We are planning to adapt to Manifest v3 in Firefox as they will support the feature Libredirect needs. If other Browsers do support Mozilla Policy. You might see Libredirect in Chrome Web Store.</p>
      <h2 id="why_not_manifest_v3"><a href="#why_not_manifest_v3">Why not manifest v3?</a>            </h2>
      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>As what <a href="https://github.com/SimonBrazell">@SimonBrazell</a> (Author of Privacy Redirect from which Libredirect is forked) said here: <a href="https://github.com/SimonBrazell/privacy-redirect/pull/319#issuecomment-985895209">https://github.com/SimonBrazell/privacy-redirect/pull/319#issuecomment-985895209</a></p>
      <p>"Redirecting and blocking urls is now so impossible to do with the <code>webRequest</code> function. If you take look at the <code>manifest.json</code> files of <a href="https://github.com/SimonBrazell/privacy-redirect/blob/master/src/manifest.json#L5">Privacy Redirect</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/blob/master/platform/chromium/manifest.json#L76">uBlock Origin</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/einaregilsson/Redirector/blob/master/manifest.json#L2">Redirector</a>, you'll see that they all use <code>manifest v2</code>. I can't add nor publish a <code>manifest v2</code> to the chrome web store. Read the warning in this page: <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/">https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/</code></a></p>
      <h3>Alternatives to WebRequest ?</h3>
      <p>Further reading and I saw an alternative that is <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/declarativeNetRequest/">declarativeNetRequest</a>. It's syntax which is a static one and is like a settings page for chrome to use rather than with <code>webrequest</code> where you had to pass the request to the extension and wait for it's JavaScript code to process to respond. ex: <a href ="https://github.com/libredirect/libredirect/blob/master/src/assets/javascripts/helpers/imgur.js#L103-L119">Imgur Redirect Function</a>. There's a whole lot of difference between static settings and a whole language like JavaScript processing and understanding your input and giving you an output.</p>
      <h3>What to do?</h3>
      <p>The only solution is to stay on <code>manifest v2</code> rather than <code>manifest v3</code>. The extension will still work on chromium browsers, but it can't be in the chrome web store.</p>
      <p>Thankfully there are other extension stores for chromium browsers like <a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/Microsoft-Edge-Extensions-Home">Edge Add-On Store</a>, <a href ="https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/">Opera Addons</a></p>
      <p>Edge Add-Ons doesn't accept installing an extension from their store if you're not using Edge. Opera add-ons is the same story.</p>
      <h2 id="what_is_unify_settings"><a href="#what_is_unify_settings">What is Unify settings in the Popup ?</a>   </h2>
      <p>This setting is to make the use of multiple instances consistent by unifying all the settings such as theme, language, etc...</p>
      <p>You use it by visiting one of your selected instances. Go to it's settings page. Change it's settings.</p>
      <p>Then press the Unify Button from Popup. This will copy all the settings from the current instance to all the other selected instances.</p>
      <p>Usually they're stored using cookies. We just copy those cookies to the other instances. By The Way, We don't copy critical cookies that have tokens or credential data. We copy only the cookies for customization. Some instances use localStorage instead of cookies such as Piped. We copy it too but with a different approach, though you as the user will have the same result.</p>
      <h2 id="Removed_functionalites_changes"><a href="Removed_functionalites_changes">Removed Functionalities and Changes</a></h2>
      <p>As of Libredirect v2.0, The Following Functionalities are removed or replaced :
        <li>Custom Settings for Frontends, instead Unify Settings will be used.</li>
        <li>Removed 'Bypass feature from YouTube, Nitter and Libreddit', If you want to reinstate back in the next release. Raise your voice here in this Github Issue : <a href="https://github.com/libredirect/libredirect/issues/277">https://github.com/libredirect/libredirect/issues/277</a></li>
        <li>Always used Preferred Instances because it just makes more confusion and complexity to the code than it's benefits. </li>
        <li>Instances that use Cloudflare CDN are disabled by default because Cloudflare CDN may acts as an Man-in-the-Middle Attack and get unencrypted data about you.</li>
        <li>Frontends such as Librespeed, PixivMoe and Soju are removed.</li>
        <li>Beatbump is disabled by Default because the Only Instance of it uses Clouflare CDN.</li>
